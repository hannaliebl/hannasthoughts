Hi! My name is Hanna Liebl. I'm a software developer, and I have been keeping [a blog about programming and tech](https://hannaliebl.com/blog) on my primary domain, [hannaliebl.com](https://hannaliebl.com), for a few years now, but I sometimes find myself wanting to write about topics not directly related to coding, so this is where those posts find their home.

I have been trying to find the corners of the web that aren't controlled by giant companies in walled-off gardens of content, which reminds me of the "old web" that existed right when I started getting into HTML and CSS in the first place. I find old-school blogging to be a nice part of that, and this is my attempt to add to that world.

Speaking of walled-off gardens...I do have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lieblhan), and if you'd like to get in touch, that's a decent way to do so. You can also [email me](mailto:hanna.liebl@gmail.com?subject=Hi!).
